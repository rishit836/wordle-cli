# **Python Wordle Game**

## **Project Overview**

This project is a command-line implementation of the popular word-guessing game, "Wordle." Developed using Python, this application utilizes file handling to access a database of words and implements string manipulation logic to provide real-time feedback to the user. The game challenges players to deduce a hidden five-letter word within five attempts.

## **Features**

* **Automatic Word List Retrieval**: Includes a utility script (wordle.py) to fetch the latest list of valid game words from an online source.  
* **Random Word Generation**: The system randomly selects a target word from the generated words.txt file at the start of every game.  
* **Input Validation**: The program ensures that user inputs strictly adhere to the five-letter length constraint.  
* **Visual Feedback System**:  
  * **Uppercase**: Indicates the letter is correct and in the correct position.  
  * **Lowercase**: Indicates the letter exists in the target word but is currently in the wrong position.  
  * **Underscore (\_)**: Indicates the letter does not exist in the target word.  
* **Replayability**: Users are offered the option to continue playing a new round or exit the application upon game completion.  
* **Score Tracking**: The game tracks the number of guesses used for a successful attempt.

## **Prerequisites**

To run this application, the following are required:

* Python 3.x installed on the system.  
* The requests library (used for fetching the word list).

## **Installation and Setup**

1. **Verify Python**: Ensure Python is installed by typing python \--version in your terminal.  
2. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required external library by running:  
   pip install requests

3. **Prepare the Game**: Place main.py and wordle.py in the same directory.  
4. **Generate Word List**: Run the setup script to download the word database:  
   python wordle.py

   *This will create the words.txt file automatically.*

## **Usage**

Once the word list has been generated, run the game using the following command:

python main.py

Upon execution, the game rules will be displayed. Press ENTER to begin the game loop. Enter your five-letter guesses into the terminal when prompted.

## **Game Logic and Algorithm**

The core logic iterates through the user's input string and compares it against the target word using the following conditions:

1. **Exact Match**: If the character at index i of the guess matches the character at index i of the target word, it is displayed in uppercase.  
2. **Partial Match**: If the character exists in the target word but allows for positional correction, it is displayed in lowercase.  
3. **No Match**: If the character is not found in the relevant portion of the target word, an underscore is printed.

## **File Structure**

* main.py: Contains the source code, game loop, and logic.  
* wordle.py: A utility script that fetches the list of valid words from an online source and saves them to a local file.  
* words.txt: The database containing valid five-letter words (generated by running wordle.py).
